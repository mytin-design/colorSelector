I want to create a program that
1. Gives me like 20 colors to choose from
From the 20, I can choose 5

These should then be added to a my favorites section


# Steps
Provide the 20 colors as buttons - flex display or grid

just choose a box-layout design that makes the buttons look cool


## step 2 
create another section
named favorites, if a color is selected, it appears in the favs sections

cool right?

Now get to work Genius
